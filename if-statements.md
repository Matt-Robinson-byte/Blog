# if-statements
## Also called conditionals
### "if" statements allow us to create a way of choosing one of two paths.  Simply put they allow us to choose an action to take if a condition is met.
## Example
    if 2 > 1:
        print("2 is greater than 1")
If you have multiple conditions you can use "elif" and "else"
## elif and else example
    if 2 > 1:
        print("two is bigger")
    elif 2 < 1:
        print("two is less)
    else:
        print("who knows")
